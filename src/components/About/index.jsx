            <p>
                Hi I'm a Senior Retail Systems Integrity QA Specialist, busy musician, and budding web developer currently residing in Asbury Park, NJ.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my career in the IT industry over 16 years ago and have worked with a major supermarket co-op ever since. I felt the desire to challenge myself further and enrolled in the Rutgers Web Development bootcamp where I picked up a slew of new skills.
